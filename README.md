# Changelog for Christoffel's Menu Management App

## Project Overview
This project is a mobile application for managing a private chef's menu. The app allows the chef to add menu items, display them, and filter them by course. It also calculates and displays the average price of menu items per course.

This document outlines the changes made from the initial code to the final improved version.

## Changes made
 ### 1. Navigation Fixes
Issue: The navigation was throwing an error: The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload... was not handled by any navigator.

Fix:

.Registered the AddMenuItem screen correctly in the Stack.Navigator of App.tsx.
.Updated navigation calls in HomeScreen to ensure proper parameter passing and correct screen name usage.

### 2. Folder Structure and File Organization
Issue: Code organization was unclear and all components were in one file.
Fix:
.Split components into separate files:
.HomeScreen.tsx
.AddMenuItemScreen.tsx
.Future screens like FilterMenuScreen can also be added similarly.
.Updated imports in App.tsx to reflect the new file structure.

### 3. TypeScript Improvements
Issue: Missing type declarations caused runtime warnings and errors.

Fix:

.I added TypeScript type declarations for navigation routes using RootStackParamList.
.I Defined the MenuItem type for improved clarity and type safety.
